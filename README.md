## Building nvmefs üõ†Ô∏è

To build nvmefs, it is necessary to install the required tools beforehand. Alternatively, you can use the development container, which comes with all prerequisites pre-installed.

After prerequisties are installed type in:

```bash
cd nvmefs/
GEN=ninja make release
```

The build binaries are stored in `nvmefs/build/release` and the extension that can be loaded into client programs is stored in `nvmefs/build/release/extension/nvmefs/nvmefs.duckdb_extension`
